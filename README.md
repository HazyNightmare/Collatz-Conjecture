# Collatz-Conjecture
My personal attempt of the Collatz Conjecture function.

 The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematic conjecture that concerns a sequence defined as follows:
 start with any positive integer n.  
 The following terms are determined by these rules:
 if the number is even, divide by 2,
 if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.
 
 The sequence always finishes with squares of 2, and there has never been a number discovered
 that doesn't eventually simplify to 1.
